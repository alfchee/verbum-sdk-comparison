# OPUS Audio Encoding Upgrade

## Problem Fixed
The PCM audio encoding was causing "Speech was detected, but not recognized" errors from the Verbum API, indicating the audio format was not being processed correctly.

## Solution Implemented
Switched from PCM to OPUS encoding based on the successful Vue.js sample implementation.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. VerbumService Audio Processing
- **Removed**: PCM-based AudioContext and ScriptProcessor approach
- **Added**: MediaRecorder with OPUS codec for real-time streaming
- **Updated**: Socket connection to use `encoding: 'OPUS'` instead of `'PCM'`

### 2. Audio Configuration
- **OPUS Settings**: 
  - MIME Type: `audio/webm;codecs=opus`
  - Bitrate: 25,600 bps
  - Timeslice: 20ms chunks
- **Stream Settings**:
  - Sample Rate: 16kHz (upgraded from 8kHz)
  - Single channel (mono)
  - Echo cancellation enabled
  - Noise suppression enabled

### 3. Audio Streaming Process
```typescript
// Old PCM approach (removed)
// - AudioContext with ScriptProcessor
// - Manual Float32 to PCM16 conversion
// - Complex buffer management

// New OPUS approach (implemented)
const mediaRecorder = new MediaRecorder(mediaStream, {
  mimeType: 'audio/webm;codecs=opus',
  audioBitsPerSecond: 25600,
});

mediaRecorder.ondataavailable = (event) => {
  event.data.arrayBuffer().then((buffer) => {
    socket.emit('audioStream', buffer);
  });
};

mediaRecorder.start(20); // 20ms chunks
```

### 4. Memory Management
- Automatic blob cleanup every second to prevent memory buildup
- Proper MediaRecorder lifecycle management
- Clean disconnect and stream cleanup

## Benefits of OPUS Encoding

1. **Better Compression**: OPUS is specifically designed for real-time audio streaming
2. **Lower Latency**: Native browser support for OPUS encoding reduces processing overhead
3. **Higher Quality**: Better audio quality at lower bitrates compared to PCM
4. **API Compatibility**: Verbum API processes OPUS more reliably than raw PCM
5. **Network Efficiency**: Smaller payload sizes reduce bandwidth usage

## Testing Results Expected

After this upgrade, you should see:
- ✅ No more "Speech was detected, but not recognized" errors
- ✅ Faster initial response times
- ✅ More accurate transcriptions
- ✅ Better handling of various audio qualities
- ✅ Reduced network bandwidth usage

## Fallback Strategy

The service maintains Web Speech API fallback if Verbum connection fails, ensuring the application remains functional even with network issues.

## Next Steps for Testing

1. Start recording with both English and Spanish
2. Verify real-time transcription appears immediately
3. Check browser network tab for smaller WebSocket payload sizes
4. Compare transcription accuracy with previous PCM implementation

The audio encoding upgrade should now provide a much more stable and reliable connection to the Verbum API.
